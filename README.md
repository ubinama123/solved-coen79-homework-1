This assignment is to familiarize you with basic concepts of object oriented programming (OOP) which we will employ and exploit throughout this term.

<ul>

 <li>The first article is from: <u>https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/object-orientedprogramming-concepts-21bb035f7260/</u> It describes the tenet of OOP in a very simple language; though, very accurate. I think you will enjoy it, and we will talk about these basic concepts in the class.</li>

 <li>The 2<sup>nd</sup> article (<u>https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/data-types-in-cpp/</u>) describes basic C++ data types. You are already familiar with these data types and it is a review for all. We will discuss some of these data types in the class, too.</li>

 <li>The 3<sup>rd</sup> article is from Bjarne Stroustrup, the inventor of C++. He wrote an article (<u>http://www.stroustrup.com/Myths-final.pdf</u>) in 2014, tried to debunk couple of popular myths about C++. Please read the Introduction (section1), section 2, and section 3. It is an interesting read overall. If you know Java, you may want to read section 4 too.</li>

</ul>

Now as an assignment, I would like you to think about inheritance (something that we will talk about in week 10!) and draw an inheritance hierarchy diagram that describes the evolution of todayâ€™s horse (a mammal). Of course, you may use Wikipedia or other sources to draw the diagram.
